Creating this page saved over 90% of server resources by using templates and JS.
If you then use CSS, JS & HTML Script caching techniques you can do even better.

This page now also makes zero call backs to the server saving 100% of expensive shared resources.

Using this tool will save you more money on servers than the cost of the product itself.

Difficulty level: Beginner
A novice programmer should be able to configure and use with their own data within a day.
The different category data sources and demo data parts make it look more complicated than an actual real world example. Once you strip back what you will not be using everything is much clearer. So we also decided to include live _example_ versions. Simply swap 1 line of code in the index.

More useful than it may initially appear. Can be adapted/configured for use with any feature from e-commerce, forums, feedback, F.A.Q., displaying/filtering anything you can think of.

Universal code allows you to use it for multiple applications but you are permitted to duplicate and use as many times as you wish on the same website. Different website, new licence required.

Since the web tool works using exclusively JavaScript functions it takes all load off the server because all user input is processed client side. Plus it reduces payload by caching and downloads only once.

The server is only used to retrieve data from a database. Once obtained you can click away with no internet connection all day long.

No other system exists that is more efficient and faster. Power simplified.

Why pay multiple times as much for something that is multiple times slower.

It saves time whilst reducing internet bandwidth and saves money because server loads are considerably reduced so you can fit more users on them.

Which in turn saves energy and reduces CO2 emissions caused by the energy servers require to operate and the extensive cooling systems they must have due to waste heat production from storage devices, memory and processors. Savings don't just stop there. The final device will also require less resources too.


We've done the hard work.
